[1024cores by Dmitry Vyukov](https://www.1024cores.net/home) is one of the best concurrency-related documents on earth especially for C++ programmers.
It's dated around the early 2010s, but still relevant enough.
I am eager to write him to write a book about concurrency programs in C++, but there is no such book as of now.

So I made an epub for his site. 
I choose only relevant pages for concurrent programming and skip some empty pages.

I can't open this epub in Google Play Books (I don't know the reason), but I can read by other apps like Rakuten Kobo and Bookwalker (I use Rakuten Kobo for reading).

This epub is made by following colab script: [1024cores epub colab.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-i8U5bst0iWrST5JtXHt40JlhZ1lju3o?usp=sharing)
